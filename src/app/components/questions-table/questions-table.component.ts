/*
After the candidate has given their introduction,
the screener will proceed to the question-and-answer part of the interview.
A list of questions will be fetched from the server / database,
based on the skills that the screener input on the candidate introduction page.
Screener will be able to see a set of category tabs,
each of which has a set of questions in a table.

Screener has the ability to navigate between tabs ad nauseam,
asking whichever questions they desire. When a screener asks a question,
it will invoke an instance of the question component.

Possible change for the future there are no programmatic constraints
on how many questions a screener can ask, nor are there any constraints
on what the proportion of questions must be (x% Java, y% HTML, z% SQL, etc).
Future iterations may change this.
